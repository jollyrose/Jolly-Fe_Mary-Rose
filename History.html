                <p>The first mechanical computer device was conceptualised and invented by English mechanical engineer and polymath Charles Babbage in the early 19th century. Called the ‘Difference Engine,’ it was originally created to aid in navigational calculations. Often referred to as the ‘Father of the Computer’, Babbage came up with the more general ‘Analytical Engine’ in 1833 which could be used in fields other than navigation. Funding constraints meant that Babbage died without seeing his machine completed, however his son Henry completed a much simpler version of the machine in 1888, which was successfully demonstrated to the public in 1906.

                    Early computers were not developed until the mid 1900s, when a more compact analogue electromechanical computer, that used trigonometry, was installed on a submarine to solve a problem with firing torpedoes at moving targets.
                    
                    The Z2, the first electromechanical digital computer, invented by Engineer Konrad Zuse in 1939, used electric switches to drive, and relays to perform calculations. Devices like the Z2 had very low operating speeds and were eventually succeeded by faster all electric machines, such as the first fully automatic 1941 Z3, also created by Zuse.
                    
                    Colossus, a set of computers created between 1943 – 1945, are widely recognised as the world’s first programmable electronic digital computers. Popularised by its use during World War II Colossus were used in intercepting and deciphering encrypted German communications from the Enigma machine. English computer scientist, mathematician, and theoretical biologist Alan Turing conceptualised modern computers in his 1936 seminal paper ‘On Computable Numbers’, whereby programmable instructions are stored in the memory of a machine.
                    
                    Another early programmable computer was the Manchester Mark 1 developed by the Victoria University of Manchester. Frederic C. Williams, Tom Kilburn, and Geoff Tootill began working on the machine in August of 1948, but the first operational version of the computer was not available for use until 1949. The Manchester Mark 1 caused controversy when British media outlets referred to it as an electronic brain, which provoked a long-running debate with the department of Neurosurgery at Manchester University. They asked whether an electronic computer could ever be truly creative.
                    
                    It was not until 1951 when electrical engineering company Ferranti International plc created the Ferranti Mark 1; that the world’s first general-purpose computer was commercially available. Also called the Manchester Electronic Computer, the Ferranti Mark 1 was first utilised by the Victoria University of Manchester.
                    
                    The first computer used in processing commercial business applications was developed by the Lyons Tea Corporation to increase business output in 1951 – Leo I.</p>

                <p>For a clear history of the evolution of computer science, it’s helpful to flesh out a timeline of some of the main events that helped build the industry.

                    After Lady Ada Lovelace and Charles Babbage began work on machine-based operations in the 1830s and early 1840s, computer science and developing technology mostly focused on astronomy and navigation. The next real milestone would be marked by the invention of the punch card system, invented by Herman Hollerith in the 1890s to calculate US census numbers in a matter of months instead of the years it took to count by hand.
                    
                    Early 20th-century computing was pushed forward by the wars and the need to develop programmable electronic computers to support the war effort. From 1943 to 1945 a group of scientists, including John Von Neumann and two professors from the University of Pennsylvania—John Mauchly and J.Presper Eckert—designed and built the Electronic Numerical Integrator and Calculator (ENIAC).
                    
                    As the previously mentioned Times article describes, ENIAC weighed more than 30 tons. “Merely getting it to work was seen as the heroic, manly engineering feat,” the Times reports. Women handled the programming: Kathleen McNulty, Jean Jennings, Betty Snyder, Marlyn Wescoff, Frances Bilas and Ruth Lichterman all contributed. “The men would figure out what they wanted Eniac to do; the women ‘programmed’ it to execute the instructions.” The group hoped to use Eniac to determine rocket trajectories, but the machine was so large that WWII was over before it could be spooled up.
                    
                    World War II also saw the work of British code breaker Alan Turing, who asked the question “can computers think?” His early computer model, the Turing machine, and Turing Test—now seen as one of the first efforts at artificial intelligence—were visionary contributions by this only recently honored computer scientist.
                    
                    Following the knitted histories of military and computer science in the early 1950s, Grace Hopper, a Navy rear admiral, is credited with developing the first compiler program which led to the development of the first standardized computer language: COBOL (common business-oriented language); Fortran, Snobol and Lisp would follow.
                    
                    Later that decade, unrelated to any US or UK military cooperation, electrical engineers Jack Kilby and Robert Noyce nearly simultaneously (and independently) came up with the idea of a miniature integrated circuit or microchip.
                    
                    In the early 1960s, Purdue University developed the first computer science department and bachelor’s degree program, with faculty members working in real-time to create textbooks and punch cards for newly welcomed computer science majors.
                    
                    Over the next decades the world would see the invention of the computer mouse. IBM’s many contributions included the floppy disc. Apple, Microsoft and the personal computer arose, as did home-modified artificial intelligence and robotics and the computer engineering we use in tiny hand-held supercomputers.</p>

                        <p> Information systems were first introduced in the 1960s to deal with accounting management issues. They had however been in use in the previous years as computers strive to evolve. Even the first machines that used vacuum tubes and transistors had the capability that the information systems have today. Businesspeople used them and also scientists to perform tasks that had proven challenging to perform manually (Peppard, 2016). Simple arithmetic problems could be solved using the computers however the results were recorded down on paper.

                            People made use of the computers to exhaustively improve the activities they were indulging in until the 1960s when they were able to use an accounting information system in their businesses.
                            
                            Since specific laws, however, govern accounting management, the software had to be adjusted to cater for all the requirements. The introduction of the accounting management software triggered the presentation of information systems in all various areas of management. Managers saw how effective a software could be in monitoring all accounting information and decided to incorporate information systems companywide (Laudon, 2016). It was in the urge and desire to ease business operations and improve records management in the whole organization.
                            
                            Several information systems were then developed to aid in managing invoices, paying and keeping order records. Such operations were kept stored in the developed information systems. They were all integrated with the already existing accounting management software. This improved productivity, guaranteed safe working time and reduced costs and mistakes. Inventory control systems were developed nearly for all companies. It was a great improvement in the optimization of processes that the companies got involved in.
                            
                            Material Requirement Planning systems were then introduced in the early 1970s. These were effectively used in the monitoring of all materials that were used in the production of a particular commodity. A bill of materials could be prepared, and inventory databases kept. They were major systems in manufacturing industries to monitor the whole process of manufacturing. It notably increased the efficiency of production and supply. This called for its continued use in all the manufacturing companies (Cragg, 1995). All manufacturing costs could also be kept using the systems. They could then be manipulated using the accounting management systems that had been previously introduced. This vitally improved the manufacturing process in the companies that installed them.
                            
                            Material Resource Planning systems were a great contribution to the achievement of outstanding advancements in business operations. These systems, however, seemed to overlook capacity constraints.<br><br><br> This led to the introduction of MRP II systems in the 1980s. This newly developed information system infrastructure took into account all management necessities, all material planning and the needed resources and the capacity for manufacturing products. They were focused on the production area. They would, however, integrate themselves in other systems that were being used in other management areas.
                            
                            As the information systems evolved over the years, new functionalities were added every other time. Other areas of management were integrated into the already installed computer systems. Many organizations grew drastically out of the installation and use of various information systems that were being upgraded each time (Peppard, 2016). All the areas seemed to be drifting to the information system environments. They had proven very efficient in performing business operations.
                            
                            With the continued growth and development of information systems, Material Resources Planning II systems gradually evolved to integrate all the levels of management. New functionalities were added to the systems so that other management areas were covered. These areas included human resources, logistics, manufacturing, finance, inventory, distribution, marketing, general management, customer relationship management and much more. This brought up the introduction of Entity Resource Planning concept in the involved companies. Many information systems were now integrated into one single platform where all business activities were kept (Panetto, 2014). A clear relationship among all the databases involved in the business activities was established. It has provided clear interrelationships of information across the whole company.
                            
                                       Advancements in networking technologies has facilitated the proper functioning of information systems. It has been a contributing factor to the integration of systems organization-wide.<br><br><br> Networked information systems have led to the rapid developments in the Enterprise Resource Systems that are there today. They have been considered as a consequence of the evolution of many information systems over time.
                            
                             The information systems that have been put in place in the current world aim at improving both the internal and the external environment. They have provisions for users of the system who are in the organization and also those that are from outside. Both internal and external processes are catered for efficiently in the management information systems (Panetto, 2014). This eases all business activities that companies are obligated to perform. Competitive advantage is then achieved gradually as the companies grow.
                            
                             Traditional ERP systems covered all the internal business activities of the company. Activities like accounting, planning, and operations adopted the Enterprise Resource Planning information system and optimized their performance. Integrated information systems for company management were put up to aid in the generation of several benefits of a company. They led to the uniqueness of data, the flow of information through the various processes and improved traceability of company funds and resources. They also acted as analytical tools to aid in the internal analysis of the company involved.
                            
                                       The traditional ERP grew into ERP II with time. The two were notably different. Their process and nature were not similar at all. Traditional ERPs considered operations inside the organization while ERP II systems were developed to aid the company to efficiently interact with its business environment and the generated integration of all functionalities of the company.</p>
